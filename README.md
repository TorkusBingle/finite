The purpose of our study is to help offset migratory fatalities using machine learning, specifically a time series.

This is accomplished by providing an interface where the user selects their anticipated date of migration and the route that they intend to travel.

After these selections are made the output will show the user a predicted amount of indidents that will occur based on the time and location parameters.

Addiitonally we have implemented a histogram that provides insight into the variations of indident that individuals have previously suffered on the route chosen.

Thanks for visiting, safe travels!
